A very simple NBA Player Comparer that was inspired by the "compare" tool in renderz.app. 
I treated this project as a tune-up project for my "StatTwin" project, as I had to become familiar how to process the JSON files I made for NBA Players.

The app's functionality is very simple. You choose a 2 players to compare, and the app will color code which player has a better stat.
