An all-in-one Wordle tool! This app contains 3 elements: The Wordle Game, a Wordle solver, and a page to view your past Wordle solves. 

For the Wordle solver, you enter in a word, mark how the word did by clicking on the letters (gray, yellow, green), and then submit it by clicking "enter". After you submit the word, 
the word will be proccessed and contribute to possible answer options. After repeating this process until success, mark if the tool worked and click "Save and Dismiss".

When you press "Save and Dismiss", this run will be saved to a SwiftData Query, allowing you to view this run in the "Past Runs" page. In the "Past Runs" page, you can sort your runs by most recent, oldest, and most efficent!
